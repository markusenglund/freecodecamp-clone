When you have a set of data, you can apply D3 methods to display it on the page. Data comes in many formats, but this challenge uses a simple array of numbers.","The first step is to make D3 aware of the data. The <code>data()</code> method is used on a selection of DOM elements to attach the data to those elements. The data set is passed as an argument to the method.","A common workflow pattern is to create a new element in the document for each piece of data in the set. D3 has the <code>enter()</code> method for this purpose.","When <code>enter()</code> is combined with the <code>data()</code> method, it looks at the selected elements from the page and compares them to the number of data items in the set. If there are fewer elements than data items, it creates the missing elements.","Here is an example that selects a <code>ul</code> element and creates a new list item based on the number of entries in the array:","<blockquote>&lt;body&gt;<br>  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br>  &lt;script&gt;<br>    const dataset = [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"];<br>    d3.select(\"ul\").selectAll(\"li\")<br>      .data(dataset)<br>      .enter()<br>      .append(\"li\")<br>      .text(\"New item\");<br>  &lt;/script&gt;<br>&lt;/body&gt;</blockquote>","It may seem confusing to select elements that don't exist yet. This code is telling D3 to first select the <code>ul</code> on the page. Next, select all list items, which returns an empty selection. Then the <code>data()</code> method reviews the dataset and runs the following code three times, once for each item in the array. The <code>enter()</code> method sees there are no <code>li</code> elements on the page, but it needs 3 (one for each piece of data in <code>dataset</code>). New <code>li</code> elements are appended to the <code>ul</code> and have the text \"New item\".","<hr>","Select the <code>body</code> node, then select all <code>h2</code> elements.

Given an array of unsorted items, we want to be able to return a sorted array. We will see several different methods to do this and learn some tradeoffs between these different approaches. While most modern languages have built-in sorting methods for operations like this, it is still important to understand some of the common basic approaches and learn how they can be implemented.","Here we will see bubble sort. The bubble sort method starts at the beginning of an unsorted array and 'bubbles up' unsorted values towards the end, iterating through the array until it is completely sorted. It does this by comparing adjacent items and swapping them if they are out of order.

Like quick sort, merge sort also uses a divide-and-conquer, recursive methodology to sort an array. It takes advantage of the fact that it is relatively easy to sort two arrays as long as each is sorted in the first place. But we'll start with only one array as input, so how do we get to two sorted arrays from that? Well, we can recursively divide the original input in two until we reach the base case of an array with one item. A single-item array is naturally sorted, so then we can start combining. This combination will unwind the recursive calls that split the original array, eventually producing a final sorted array of all the elements. The steps of merge sort, then, are:","<strong>1)</strong> Recursively split the input array in half until a sub-array with only one element is produced.","<strong>2)</strong> Merge each sorted sub-array together to produce the final sorted array.","Merge sort is an efficient sorting method, with time complexity of <i>O(nlog(n))</i>. This algorithm is popular because it is performant and relatively easy to implement.","As an aside, this will be the last sorting algorithm we cover here. However, later in the section on tree data structures we will describe heap sort, another efficient sorting method that requires a binary heap in its implementation.","<strong>Instructions:</strong> Write a function <code>mergeSort</code> which takes an array of integers as input and returns an array of these integers in sorted order from least to greatest. A good way to implement this is to write one function, for instance <code>merge</code>, which is responsible for merging two sorted arrays, and another function, for instance <code>mergeSort</code>, which is responsible for the recursion that produces single-item arrays to feed into merge.

A hash is basically a fingerprint of the original data- always unique. This is accomplished by feeding the original data into a algorithm and having returned a fixed length result.

Cost is about how much power it takes to compute the hash. It is on a logarithmic scale of 2^cost and determines how many times the data is put through the hashing algorithm.

APIs are tools that computers use to communicate with one another, in part to send and receive data. You can use API functionality in your page once you understand how to make requests and process data from it. Programmers often use AJAX technologies when working with APIs.<br><br>The term AJAX originated as an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. It refers to a group of technologies that make asynchronous requests to a server to transfer data, then load any returned data into the page. An asynchronous process has a couple key properties. The browser does not stop loading a page to wait for the server's response. Also, the browser inserts updated data into part of the page without having to refresh the entire page.<br><br>User experience benefits from asynchronous processes in several ways. Pages load faster since the browser isn't waiting for the server to respond in the middle of a page render. Requests and transfers happen in the background, without interrupting what the user is doing. When the browser receives new data, only the necessary area of the page refreshes. These qualities especially enhance the user experience for single page applications.<br><br>The data transferred between the browser and server is often in a format called JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). JSON resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, except that it's transferred as a string. Once received, it can be converted into an object and used in a script.<br><br>This section covers how to transfer and use data using AJAX technologies with a freeCodeCamp API.",""]],"tests":[],"head":[],"tail":[],"helpRoom":"Help","fileName":"04-data-visualization/json-apis-and-ajax.json","challengeSeed":[],"challengeType":7,"solutions":[],"releasedOn":"Feb 17, 2017","required":[{"link":"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.css"}],"blockId":"59a6ea95f9cfb91d7ed43936","isRequired":false,"isLocked":false,"time":"2 hours","isTranslated":false},"introduction-to-the-basic-node-and-express-challenges":{"id":"587d7fb0367417b2b2512bec","name":"Introduction to the Basic Node and Express Challenges","title":"Introduction to the Basic Node and Express Challenges","type":"waypoint","order":2,"suborder":1,"checksum":2087748576,"isBeta":false,"isComingSoon":false,"dashedName":"introduction-to-the-basic-node-and-express-challenges","superBlock":"Apis And Microservices","superOrder":5,"hint":[],"block":"basic-node-and-express","description":[["","","Node.js is a JavaScript tool that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript.

A circular queue is basically a queue that writes to the end of a collection then begins over writing itself at the beginning of the collection. This is type of data structure has some useful applications in certain situations. For example, a circular queue can be used for streaming media. Once the queue is full, new media data simply begins to overwrite old data.","A good way to illustrate this concept is with an array:","<blockquote>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br> ^Read @ 0<br> ^Write @ 0</blockquote>","Here the read and write are both at position <code>0</code>. Now the queue gets 3 new records <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>. Our queue now looks like:","<blockquote>[a, b, c, 4, 5]<br> ^Read @ 0<br>       ^Write @ 3</blockquote>","As the read head reads, it can remove values or keep them:","<blockquote>[null, null, null, 4, 5]<br>                   ^Read @ 3<br>                   ^Write @ 3</blockquote>","Once the write reaches the end of the array it loops back to the beginning:","<blockquote>[f, null, null, d, e]<br>                ^Read @ 3<br> ^Write @ 1</blockquote>","This approach requires a constant amount of memory but allows files of a much larger size to be processed.","Instructions:","In this challenge we will implement a circular queue. The circular queue should provide <code>enqueue</code> and <code>dequeue</code> methods which allow you to read from and write to the queue. The class itself should also accept an integer which you can use to specify the size of the queue when you create it. We've written the starting version of this class for you in the code editor. When you enqueue items to the queue, the write pointer should advance forward and loop back to the beginning once it reaches the end of the queue. Likewise, the read pointer should advance forward as you dequeue items. The write pointer should not be allowed to move past the read pointer (our class won't let you overwrite data you haven't read yet) and the read pointer should not be able to advance past data you have written.","In addition, the <code>enqueue</code> method should return the item you enqueued if it is successfully and otherwise return <code>null</code>.

Microservices","superOrder":5,"hint":[],"block":"basic-node-and-express","description":["Before we introduced the <code>express.static()</code> middleware function. Now it’s time to see what middleware is, in more detail. Middleware functions are functions that take 3 arguments: the request object, the response object, and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions execute some code that can have side effects on the app, and usually add informations to the request or response objects. They can also end the cycle sending the response, when some condition is met. If they don’t send the response, when they are done they start the execution of the next function in the stack. This is triggered calling the 3rd argument <code>next()</code>. More information in the <a href='http://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html' target='_blank'>express documentation</a>.","Look at the following example :","<blockquote>function(req, res, next) {<br>  console.log(\"I'm a middleware...\");<br>  next();<br>}</blockquote>","Let’s suppose we mounted this function on a route. When a request matches the route, it displays the string “I’m a middleware…”. Then it executes the next function in the stack.","In this exercise we are going to build a root-level middleware. As we have seen in challenge 4, to mount a middleware function at root level we can use the method <code>app.use(&lt;mware-function&gt;)</code>. In this case the function will be executed for all the requests, but you can also set more specific conditions. For example, if you want a function to be executed only for POST requests, you could use <code>app.post(&lt;mware-function&gt;)</code>. Analogous methods exist for all the http verbs (GET, DELETE, PUT, …).","Build a simple logger. For every request, it should log in the console a string taking the following format: <code>method path - ip</code>. An example would look like: <code>GET /json - ::ffff:127.0.0.1</code>. Note that there is a space between <code>method</code> and <code>path</code> and that the dash separating <code>path</code> and <code>ip</code> is surrounded by a space on either side. You can get the request method (http verb), the relative route path, and the caller’s ip from the request object, using <code>req.method</code>, <code>req.path</code> and <code>req.ip</code>. Remember to call <code>next()</code> when you are done, or your server will be stuck forever. Be sure to have the ‘Logs’ opened, and see what happens when some request arrives…","Hint: Express evaluates functions in the order they appear in the code. This is true for middleware too.

We don’t have a database in this project, but we are going to learn how to handle POST requests anyway.","In these kind of requests the data doesn’t appear in the URL, it is hidden in the request body. This is a part of the HTML request, also called payload. Since HTML is text based, even if you don’t see the data, it doesn’t mean that they are secret. The raw content of an HTTP POST request is shown below:","<blockquote>POST /path/subpath HTTP/1.0<br>From: john@example.com<br>User-Agent: someBrowser/1.0<br>Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded<br>Content-Length: 20<br>name=John+Doe&age=25</blockquote>","As you can see the body is encoded like the query string.

This one is used to upload binary files.","In this exercise we will use an urlencoded body.","To parse the data coming from POST requests, you have to install a package: the body-parser. This package allows you to use a series of middleware, which can decode data in different formats. See the docs <a href=\"https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser\" target=\"_blank\" >here</a>.","Install the body-parser module in your package.json. Then require it at the top of the file. Store it in a variable named bodyParser.","The middleware to handle url encoded data is returned by <code>bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false})</code>. <code>extended=false</code> is a configuration option that tells the parser to use the classic encoding. When using it, values can be only strings or arrays. The extended version allows more data flexibility, but it is outmatched by JSON.

A Hash table is used to implement associative arrays, or mappings of key-value pairs, like the objects and Maps we have just been studying. A JavaScript object could be implemented as a hash table, for instance (its actual implementation will depend on the environment it's running in). The way a hash table works is that it takes a key input and hashes this key in a deterministic way to some numerical value. This numerical value is then used as the actual key the associated value is stored by. Then, if you try to access the same key again, the hashing function will process the key, return the same numerical result, which will then be used to look up the associated value. This provides very efficient O(n) lookup time on average.","Hash tables can be implemented as arrays with hash functions producing array indices within a specified range. In this method, the choice of the array size is important, as is the hashing function. For instance, what if the hashing function produces the same value for two different keys? This is called a collision. One way to handle collisions is to just store both key-value pairs at that index. Then, upon lookup of either, you would have to iterate through the bucket of items to find the key you are looking for. A good hashing function will minimize collisions to maintain efficient search time.","Here, we won't be concerned with the details of hashing or hash table implementation, we will just try to get a general sense of how they work.","Instructions: Let's create the basic functionality of a hash table. We've created a naive hashing function for you to use. You can pass a string value to the function hash and it will return a hashed value you can use as a key for storage.

Trees are an important and versatile data structure in computer science. Of course, their name comes from the fact that when visualized they look much like the trees we are familiar with in the natural world. A tree data structure begins with one node, typically referred to as the root, and from here branches out to additional nodes, each of which may have more child nodes, and so on and so forth. The data structure is usually visualized with the root node at the top; you can think of it as a natural tree flipped upside down.","First, let's describe some common terminology we will encounter with trees. The root node is the top of the tree. Data points in the tree are called nodes. Nodes with branches leading to other nodes are referred to as the parent of the node the branch leads to (the child). Other more complicated familial terms apply as you might expect. A subtree refers to all the descendants of a particular node, branches may be referred to as edges, and leaf nodes are nodes at the end of the tree that have no children. Finally, note that trees are inherently recursive data structures. That is, any children of a node are parents of their own subtree, and so on. The recursive nature of trees is important to understand when designing algorithms for common tree operations.","To begin, we will discuss a particular type of a tree, the binary tree. In fact, we will actually discuss a particular binary tree, a binary search tree. Let's describe what this means. While the tree data structure can have any number of branches at a single node, a binary tree can only have two branches for every node. Furthermore, a binary search tree is ordered with respective to the child subtrees, such that each left subtree is less than or equal to the parent node, and each right subtree is greater than or equal to the parent node. Binary search trees are very common and useful data structures because they provide logarithmic time in the average case for several common operations such as lookup, insertion, and deletion.","Instructions: We'll start simple. We've defined the skeleton of a binary search tree structure here in addition to a function to create nodes for our tree. Observe that each node may have a left and right value. These will be assigned child subtrees if they exist. In our binary search tree, define two methods,","findMin and findMax. These methods should return the minimum and maximum value held in the binary search tree. If you get stuck, reflect on the invariant that must be true for binary search trees: each left subtree is less than or equal to its parent and each right subtree is greater than or equal to","its parent. Let's also say that our tree can only store integer values. If the tree is empty, either method should return null."],"tests":["assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof BinarySearchTree !== 'undefined') { test = new BinarySearchTree() }; return (typeof test == 'object')})(), 'message: The BinarySearchTree data structure exists.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof BinarySearchTree !== 'undefined') { test = new BinarySearchTree() } else { return false; }; return (typeof test.findMin == 'function')})(), 'message: The binary search tree has a method called findMin.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof BinarySearchTree !== 'undefined') { test = new BinarySearchTree() } else { return false; }; return (typeof test.findMax == 'function')})(), 'message: The binary search tree has a method called findMax.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof BinarySearchTree !== 'undefined') { test = new BinarySearchTree() } else { return false; }; if (typeof test.findMin !== 'function') { return false; }; test.add(4); test.add(1); test.add(7); test.add(87); test.add(34); test.add(45); test.add(73); test.add(8); return test.findMin() == 1; })(), 'message: The findMin method returns the minimum value in the binary search tree.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof BinarySearchTree !== 'undefined') { test = new BinarySearchTree() } else { return false; }; if (typeof test.findMax !== 'function') { return false; }; test.add(4); test.add(1); test.add(7); test.add(87); test.add(34); test.add(45); test.add(73); test.add(8); return test.findMax() == 87; })(), 'message: The findMax method returns the maximum value in the binary search tree.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof BinarySearchTree !== 'undefined') { test = new BinarySearchTree() } else { return false; }; if (typeof test.findMin !== 'function') { return false; }; if (typeof test.findMax !== 'function') { return false; }; return (test.findMin() == null && test.findMax() == null) })(), 'message: The findMin and findMax methods return null for an empty tree.');"],"head":[],"tail":["BinarySearchTree.prototype = {","    add: function(value) {","        var node = this.root;","        if (node == null) {","          this.root = new Node(value);","          return;","        } else {","            function searchTree(node) {","                if (value < node.value) {","                    if (node.left == null) {","                        node.left = new Node(value);","                        return;","                    } else if (node.left != null) {","                        return searchTree(node.left)","                    };","                } else if (value > node.value) {","                    if (node.right == null) {","                        node.right = new Node(value);","                        return;","                    } else if (node.right != null) {","                        return searchTree(node.right);","                    };","                } else {","                    return null;","                };","            };","            return searchTree(node);","        };","    }","};"],"helpRoom":"HelpJavaScript","fileName":"08-coding-interview-questions-and-take-home-assignments/coding-interview-data-structure-questions.json","challengeSeed":["var displayTree = (tree) => console.log(JSON.stringify(tree, null, 2));","function Node(value) {","    this.value = value;","    this.left = null;","    this.right = null;","}","function BinarySearchTree() {","    this.root = null;","    // change code below this line","    // change code above this line","}"],"challengeType":1,"solutions":[],"releasedOn":"Feb 17, 2017","required":[],"blockId":"59a6ea95f9cfb91d7ed43943","isLocked":false,"time":"","isTranslated":false},"adjust-the-hue-of-a-color":{"id":"587d78a4367417b2b2512ad4","name":"Adjust the Hue of a Color","title":"Adjust the Hue of a Color","type":"waypoint","order":2,"suborder":30,"checksum":380711360,"isBeta":false,"isComingSoon":false,"dashedName":"adjust-the-hue-of-a-color","superBlock":"Responsive Web Design","superOrder":1,"hint":[],"block":"applied-visual-design","description":["Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness.

Binary search trees provide logarithmic time for the common operations of lookup, insertion, and deletion in the average case, and linear time in the worst case. Why is this? Each of those basic operations requires us to find an item in the tree (or in the case of insertion to find where it should go) and because of the tree structure at each parent node we are branching left or right and effectively excluding half the size of the remaining tree. This makes the search proportional to the logarithm of the number of nodes in the tree, which creates logarithmic time for these operations in the average case.","Ok, but what about the worst case? Well, consider constructing a tree from the following values, adding them left to right: 10, 12, 17, 25. Following our rules for a binary search tree, we will add 12 to the right of 10, 17 to the right of this, and 25 to the right of this. Now our tree resembles a linked list and traversing it to find 25 would require us to traverse all the items in linear fashion. Hence, linear time in the worst case. The problem here is that the tree is unbalanced. We'll look a little more into what this means in the following challenges.","Instructions: In this challenge, we will create a utility for our tree.

To understand the concept of balance, let's take a look at another tree property: height. Height in a tree represents the distance from the root node to any given leaf node. Different paths in a highly branched tree structure may have different heights, but for a given tree there will be a minimum and maximum height. If the tree is balanced, these values will differ at most by one. This means that in a balanced tree, all the leaf nodes exist within the same level, or if they are not within the same level they are at most one level apart.","The property of balance is important for trees because it is what determines the efficiency of tree operations. As we explained in the last challenge, we face worst case time complexity for heavily unbalanced trees. Self-balancing trees are commonly used to account for this issue in trees with dynamic data sets. Common examples of these include AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees. These trees all contain additional internal logic which re-balance the tree when insertions or deletions create a state of imbalance.","Note: A similar property to height is depth, which refers to how far a given node is from the root node.","Instructions: Write two methods for our binary tree: findMinHeight and findMaxHeight. These methods should return an integer value for the minimum and maximum height within a given binary tree, respectively. If the node is empty let's assign it a height of -1 (that's the base case). Finally, add a third method isBalanced which returns a true or false depending on whether the tree is balanced or not.

Once you understand this basic concept, you can simply rearrange the order in which you explore the nodes and subtrees to produce any of the three searches above. For example, in post-order search we would want to recurse all the way to a leaf node before we begin to return any of the nodes themselves, whereas in pre-order search we would want to return the nodes first, and then continue recursing down the tree.","Define inorder, preorder, and postorder methods on our tree. Each of these methods should return an array of items which represent the tree traversal. Be sure to return the integer values at each node in the array, not the nodes themselves.

Deletion is difficult because removing nodes breaks links in the tree. These links must be carefully reestablished to ensure the binary tree structure is maintained. For some deletions, this means the tree must be rearranged. In general, you will encounter one of three cases when trying to delete a node:","Leaf Node: The target to delete has zero children.","One Child: The target to delete only has one child.","Two Children: The target to delete has two child nodes.","Removing a leaf node is easy, we simply remove it. Deleting a node with one child is also relatively easy, we simply remove it and link its parent to child of the node we deleted. Removing a node with two children is more difficult, however, because this creates two child nodes that need to be reconnected to the parent tree. We'll see how to deal with this case in the third challenge. Additionally, you need to be mindful of some edge cases when handling deletion. What if the tree is empty? What if the node to delete is the root node? What if there are only two elements in the tree? For now, let's handle the first case where we delete a leaf node.","Instructions: Create a method on our binary tree called remove. We'll build the logic for our deletion operation in here. First, you'll want to create a function within remove that finds the node we are trying to delete in the current tree. If the node is not present in the tree, remove should return null. Now, if the target node is a leaf node with no children, then the parent reference to it should be set to null. This effectively deletes the node from the tree. To do this, you will have to keep track of","the parent of the node we are trying to delete as well. It will also be useful to create a way to track the number of children the target node has, as this will determine which case our deletion falls under.","We will handle the second and third cases in the next challenges.

implement. Removing a node like this produces two subtrees that are no longer connected to the original tree structure. How can we reconnect them? One method is to find the smallest value in the right subtree of the target node and replace the target node with this value. Selecting the replacement in this way ensures that it is greater than every node in the left subtree it becomes the new parent of but also less than every node in the right subtree it becomes the new parent of.","Once this replacement is made the replacement node must be removed from the right subtree. Even this operation is tricky because the replacement may be a leaf or it may itself be the parent of a right subtree. If it is a leaf we must remove its parent's reference to it. Otherwise, it must be the right child of the target. In this case, we must replace the target value with the replacement value and make the target reference the replacement's right child.","Instructions: Let's finish our remove method by handling the third case. We've provided some code again for the first two cases. Add some code now to handle target nodes with two children. Any edge cases to be aware of? What if the tree has only three nodes?

A trie is an ordered search tree commonly used to hold strings, or more generically associative arrays or dynamic datasets in which the keys are strings. They are very good at storing sets of data when many keys will have overlapping prefixes, for example, all","the words in a dictionary.","Unlike a binary tree, nodes are not associated with actual values. Instead, the path to a node represents a specific key. For instance, if we wanted to store the string code in a trie, we would have four nodes, one for each letter: c — o — d — e. Following that path through all these nodes will then create code as a string — that path is the key we stored. Then, if we wanted to add the string coding, it would share the first three nodes of code before branching away after the d. In this way, large datasets can be stored very compactly. In addition, search can be very quick because it is effectively limited to the length of the string you are storing. Furthermore, unlike binary trees a node can store any number of child nodes.","As you might have guessed from the above example, some metadata is commonly stored at nodes that hold the end of a key so that on later traversals that key can still be retrieved. For instance, if we added codes in our example above we would need some way to know that the e in code represents the end of a key that was previously entered. Otherwise, this information would effectively be lost when we add codes.","Instructions: Let's create a trie to store words. It will accept words through an add method and store these in a trie data structure. It will also allow us to query if a given string is a word with an isWord method, and retrieve all the words entered into the trie with a print method. isWord should return a","boolean value and print should return an array of all these words as string values.","In order for us to verify that this data structure is implemented correctly, we've provided a Node structure for each node in the tree.

A binary heap is a partially ordered binary tree which satisfies the heap property. The heap property specifies a relationship between parent and child nodes. You may have a max heap, in which all parent nodes are greater than or equal to their child nodes, or a min heap, in which the reverse is true. Binary heaps are also complete binary trees. This means that all levels of the tree are fully filled and if the last level is partially filled it is filled from left to right.","While binary heaps may be implemented as tree structures with nodes that contain left and right references, the partial ordering according to the heap property allows us to represent the heap with an array. The parent-children relationship is what we're interested in and with simple arithmetic we can compute the children of any parent and the parent of any child node.","For instance, consider this array representation of a binary max heap:","<code>[ 76, 63, 48, 42, 37, 6, 42, 22 ]</code>","The root node is the first element, 6. Its children are 22 and 30. If we look at the relationship between the array indices of these values, for index i the children are 2 * i + 1 and 2 * i + 2. Similarly, the element at index 0 is the parent of these two children at indices 1 and 2. More generally, we can find the parent of a node at any index with the following: i - 1 / 2. These patterns will hold true as the binary tree grows to any size. Finally, we can make a slight adjustment to make this arithmetic even easier by skipping the first element in the array. Doing this creates the following relationship for any element at a given index i:","Example Array representation: <code>[ null, 76, 63, 48, 42, 37, 6, 42, 22 ]</code>","An element's left child: i * 2","An element's right child: i * 2 + 1","An element's parent: i / 2","Once you wrap your head around the math, using an array representation is very useful because node locations can be quickly determined with this arithmetic and memory usage is diminished because you don't need to maintain references to child nodes.","Instructions: Here we will create a max heap. Start by just creating an insert method which adds elements to our heap. During insertion, it is important to always maintain the heap property. For a max heap this means the root element should always have the greatest value in the tree and all parent nodes should be greater than their children. For an array implementation of a heap, this is typically accomplished in three steps:","Add the new element to the end of the array.","If the element is larger than its parents, switch them.","Continue switching until the new element is either smaller than its parent or you reach the root of the tree.","Finally, add a print method which returns an array of all the items that have been added to the heap."],"tests":["assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof MaxHeap !== 'undefined') { test = new MaxHeap() }; return (typeof test == 'object')})(), 'message: The MaxHeap data structure exists.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof MaxHeap !== 'undefined') { test = new MaxHeap() } else { return false; }; return (typeof test.insert == 'function')})(), 'message: MaxHeap has a method called insert.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof MaxHeap !== 'undefined') { test = new MaxHeap() } else { return false; }; return (typeof test.print == 'function')})(), 'message: MaxHeap has a method called print.');","assert((function() { var test = false; if (typeof MaxHeap !== 'undefined') { test = new MaxHeap() } else { return false; }; test.insert(50); test.insert(100); test.insert(700); test.insert(32); test.insert(51); let result = test.print(); return ((result.length == 5) ? result[0] == 700 : result[1] == 700) })(), 'message: The insert method adds elements according to the max heap property.');"],"head":[],"tail":[],"helpRoom":"HelpJavaScript","fileName":"08-coding-interview-questions-and-take-home-assignments/coding-interview-data-structure-questions.json","challengeSeed":["var MaxHeap = function() {","  // change code below this line","  // change code above this line","};"],"challengeType":1,"solutions":[],"releasedOn":"Feb 17, 2017","required":[],"blockId":"59a6ea95f9cfb91d7ed43943","isLocked":false,"time":"","isTranslated":false},"learn-how-the-css-keyframes-and-animation-properties-work":{"id":"587d78a7367417b2b2512adf","name":"Learn How the CSS keyframes and animation Properties Work","title":"Learn How the CSS @keyframes and animation Properties Work","type":"waypoint","order":2,"suborder":41,"checksum":793657207,"isBeta":false,"isComingSoon":false,"dashedName":"learn-how-the-css-keyframes-and-animation-properties-work","superBlock":"Responsive Web Design","superOrder":1,"hint":[],"block":"applied-visual-design","description":["To animate an element, you need to know about the animation properties and the <code>@keyframes</code> rule.

CSS offers an option other than keywords that provides even finer control over how the animation plays out, through the use of Bezier curves.","In CSS animations, Bezier curves are used with the <code>cubic-bezier</code> function. The shape of the curve represents how the animation plays out. The curve lives on a 1 by 1 coordinate system. The X-axis of this coordinate system is the duration of the animation (think of it as a time scale), and the Y-axis is the change in the animation.","The <code>cubic-bezier</code> function consists of four main points that sit on this 1 by 1 grid: <code>p0</code>, <code>p1</code>, <code>p2</code>, and <code>p3</code>. <code>p0</code> and <code>p3</code> are set for you - they are the beginning and end points which are always located respectively at the origin (0, 0) and (1, 1). You set the x and y values for the other two points, and where you place them in the grid dictates the shape of the curve for the animation to follow. This is done in CSS by declaring the x and y values of the <code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code> \"anchor\" points in the form: <code>(x1, y1, x2, y2)</code>. Pulling it all together, here's an example of a Bezier curve in CSS code:","<code>animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.25, 0.75, 0.75);</code>","In the example above, the x and y values are equivalent for each point (x1 = 0.25 = y1 and x2 = 0.75 = y2), which if you remember from geometry class, results in a line that extends from the origin to point (1, 1).

Here's an example of a Bezier curve using values to mimic the ease-out style:","<code>animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1);</code>","Remember that all <code>cubic-bezier</code> functions start with <code>p0</code> at (0, 0) and end with <code>p3</code> at (1, 1). In this example, the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to <code>p1</code> y value of 0, then goes to <code>p2</code> y value of 1) then it moves through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for <code>p1</code>, up to 0.58 for <code>p2</code>). As a result, the change in the animated element progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to the animation duration.","<hr>","To see the effect of this Bezier curve in action, change the <code>animation-timing-function</code> of the element with id of <code>red</code> to a <code>cubic-bezier</code> function with x1, y1, x2, y2 values set respectively to 0, 0, 0.58, 1.

To serialize an object means to convert its contents into a small <em>key</em> essentially that can then be deserialized into the original object. This is what allows us to know whos communicated with the server without having to send the authentication data like username and password at each request for a new page.","To set this up properly, we need to have a serialize function and a deserialize function. In passport we create these with <code>passport.serializeUser( OURFUNCTION )</code> and <code>passport.deserializeUser( OURFUNCTION )</code>","The serializeUser is called with 2 arguments, the full user object and a callback used by passport. Returned in the callback should be a unique key to identify that user- the easiest one to use being the users _id in the object as it should be unique as it generated by MongoDb. Similarly deserializeUser is called with that key and a callback function for passport as well, but this time we have to take that key and return the users full object to the callback. To make a query search for a Mongo _id you will have to create <code>const ObjectID = require('mongodb').ObjectID;</code>, and then to use it you call <code>new ObjectID(THE_ID)</code>. Be sure to add MongoDB as a dependency. You can see this in the examples below:","<pre>passport.serializeUser((user, done) => {\n   done(null, user._id);\n });</pre><br><pre>passport.deserializeUser((id, done) => {\n        db.collection('users').findOne(\n            {_id: new ObjectID(id)},\n            (err, doc) => {\n                done(null, doc);\n            }\n        );\n    });</pre>","NOTE: This deserializeUser will throw an error until we set up the DB in the next step so comment out the whole block and just call <code>done(null, null)</code> in the function deserializeUser.","Submit your page when you think you've got it right."],"tests":[{"text":"Serialize user function correct","testString":"getUserInput => $.get(getUserInput('url')+ '/_api/server.js') .then(data => { assert.match(data, /passport.serializeUser/gi, 'You should have created your passport.serializeUser function'); assert.match(data, /null, user._id/gi, 'There should be a callback in your serializeUser with (null, user._id)'); }, xhr => { throw new Error(xhr.statusText); })"},{"text":"Deserialize user function correct","testString":"getUserInput => $.get(getUserInput('url')+ '/_api/server.js') .then(data => { assert.match(data, /passport.deserializeUser/gi, 'You should have created your passport.deserializeUser function'); assert.match(data, /null,( |)null/gi, 'There should be a callback in your deserializeUser with (null, null) for now'); }, xhr => { throw new Error(xhr.statusText); })"},{"text":"MongoDB is a dependency","testString":"getUserInput => $.get(getUserInput('url')+ '/_api/package.json') .then(data => { var packJson = JSON.parse(data); assert.property(packJson.dependencies, 'mongodb', 'Your project should list \"mongodb\" as a dependency'); }, xhr => { throw new Error(xhr.statusText); })"},{"text":"Mongodb properly required including the ObjectId","testString":"getUserInput => $.get(getUserInput('url')+ '/_api/server.js') .then(data => { assert.match(data, /require.*(\"|')mongodb(\"|')/gi, 'You should have required mongodb'); assert.match(data, /new ObjectID.*id/gi, 'Even though the block is commented out, you should use new ObjectID(id) for when we add the database'); }, xhr => { throw new Error(xhr.statusText); })"}],"head":[],"tail":[],"helpRoom":"Help","fileName":"06-information-security-and-quality-assurance/advanced-express-tools.json","challengeSeed":[],"challengeType":0,"solutions":[],"required":[],"blockId":"59a6ea95f9cfb91d7ed4393c","hints":[],"isLocked":false,"time":"5 hours","isTranslated":false},"problem-5-smallest-multiple":{"id":"59a6ea96f9cfb91d7ed4394f","name":"Problem 5 Smallest multiple","title":"Problem 5: Smallest multiple","type":"bonfire","order":3,"suborder":5,"checksum":4012345784,"isBeta":false,"isComingSoon":false,"dashedName":"problem-5-smallest-multiple","superBlock":"Coding Interview Questions And Take Home Assignments","superOrder":8,"hint":[],"block":"project-euler-problems","description":["2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.","What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?"],"tests":["assert.strictEqual(euler5(), 232792560, 'message: <code>euler5()</code> should return 232792560.');"],"head":[],"tail":[],"helpRoom":"HelpJavaScript","fileName":"08-coding-interview-questions-and-take-home-assignments/project-euler-problems.json","challengeSeed":["function euler5() {","  // Good luck!","  return true;","}","","euler5();"],"challengeType":5,"solutions":[],"required":[],"blockId":"59a6ea95f9cfb91d7ed43944","isLocked":false,"time":"","isTranslated":false},"wrap-content-in-the-article-element":{"id":"587d774e367417b2b2512aa0","name":"Wrap Content in the article Element","title":"Wrap Content in the article Element","type":"waypoint","order":3,"suborder":6,"checksum":3462272154,"isBeta":false,"isComingSoon":false,"dashedName":"wrap-content-in-the-article-element","superBlock":"Responsive Web Design","superOrder":1,"hint":[],"block":"applied-accessibility","description":["<code>article</code> is another one of the new HTML5 elements that adds semantic meaning to your markup. <code>Article</code> is a sectioning element, and is used to wrap independent, self-contained content.

You can use a strategy for allowing users to authenticate based on locally saved information (if you have them register first) or from a variety of providers such as Google or Github.

First it tries to find a user in our database with the username entered, then it checks for the password to match, then finally if no errors have popped up that we checked for, like an incorrect password, the users object is returned and they are authenticated.","Many strategies are set up using different settings, general it is easy to set it up based on the README in that strategies repository though. A good example of this is the Github strategy where we don't need to worry about a username or password because the user will be sent to Github's auth page to authenticate and as long as they are logged in and agree then Github returns their profile for us to use.","In the next step we will set up how to actually call the authentication strategy to validate a user based on form data!

Using a <code>label</code> with the <code>for</code> attribute for each radio button is sufficient.","Here's an example:","<blockquote>&lt;form&gt;<br>  &lt;fieldset&gt;<br>    &lt;legend&gt;Choose one of these three items:&lt;/legend&gt;<br>    &lt;input id=&quot;one&quot; type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;items&quot; value=&quot;one&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;label for=&quot;one&quot;&gt;Choice One&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>    &lt;input id=&quot;two&quot; type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;items&quot; value=&quot;two&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;label for=&quot;two&quot;&gt;Choice Two&lt;/label&gt;&lt;br&gt;<br>    &lt;input id=&quot;three&quot; type=&quot;radio&quot; name=&quot;items&quot; value=&quot;three&quot;&gt;<br>    &lt;label for=&quot;three&quot;&gt;Choice Three&lt;/label&gt;<br>  &lt;/fieldset&gt;<br>&lt;/form&gt;<br></blockquote>","<hr>","Camper Cat wants information about the ninja level of his users when they sign up for his email list.

Github)</li><li>Your route calls <code>passport.authenticate('github')</code> which redirects them to Github.</li><li>The page the user lands on, on Github, allows them to login if they aren't already then asks them to approve access to their profile from our app.</li><li>The user is then returned to our app at a specific callback url with their profile if they approved.</li><li>They are now authenticated and your app should check if it is a returning profile, or save it in your database if it is not.</li></ol>","Strategies with OAuth require you to have at least a <em>Client ID</em> and a <em>Client Secret</em> which is a way for them to verify who the authentication request is coming from and if it is valid. These are obtained from the site you are trying to implement authentication with, such as Github, and are unique to your app- <b>THEY ARE NOT TO BE SHARED</b> and should never be uploaded to a public repository or written directly in your code. A common practice is to put them in your <em>.env</em> file and reference them like: <code>process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID</code>. For this challenge we're going to use the Github strategy.","Obtaining your <em>Client ID and Secret<em> from Github is done in your account profile settings under 'developer settings', then '<a href='https://github.com/settings/developers'>OAuth applications</a>'. Click 'Register a new application', name your app, paste in the url to your glitch homepage (<b>Not the project code's url</b>), and lastly for the callback url, paste in the same url as the homepage but with '/auth/github/callback' added on. This is where users will be redirected to for us to handle after authenticating on Github.

Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.","","Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, $\\alpha = 30$ degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556 m3. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of $x$ metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed.

However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.","","If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of $x$ for all possible square space wastage options and calculate $\\sum x$ correct to 9 decimal places."],"tests":["assert.strictEqual(euler431(), 23.386029052, 'message: <code>euler431()</code> should return 23.386029052.');"],"head":[],"tail":[],"helpRoom":"HelpJavaScript","fileName":"08-coding-interview-questions-and-take-home-assignments/project-euler-problems.json","challengeSeed":["function euler431() {","  // Good luck!","  return true;","}","","euler431();"],"challengeType":5,"solutions":[],"required":[],"blockId":"59a6ea95f9cfb91d7ed43944","isLocked":false,"time":"","isTranslated":false},"problem-432-totient-sum":{"id":"59a6ea96f9cfb91d7ed43afa","name":"Problem 432 Totient sum","title":"Problem 432: Totient sum","type":"bonfire","order":3,"suborder":432,"checksum":2402517020,"isBeta":false,"isComingSoon":false,"dashedName":"problem-432-totient-sum","superBlock":"Coding Interview Questions And Take Home Assignments","superOrder":8,"hint":[],"block":"project-euler-problems","description":["Let S(n,m) = ∑φ(n × i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ m.

","","To cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.","","Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.","","For example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:","","","","If the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can receive power from many other floors at once, it can only send power to one other floor.","","To resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.","","Let F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of n floors.

After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either g < t, g = t, or g > t. Then the process can repeat as necessary.","","Normally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound L and upper bound H (initialized to L = 1 and H = n), let g = ⌊(L+H)/2⌋ where ⌊⋅⌋ is the integer floor function. If g = t, the process ends. Otherwise, if g < t, set L = g+1, but if g > t instead, set H = g−1. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once t is found. Even if t can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.","","Your friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting g = ⌊(L+H)/2⌋, simply let g be a random integer between L and H, inclusive.

The game starts as normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water, and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other one having also 'lapped' the other stick - that is, having made one additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.","","","On a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks' journey time is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds (inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under the bridge having lapped the other.","","","The stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the integers from a minimum, $n$, to a maximum, $m$, inclusive.

For instance, let's say you're storing a color scheme for a set of DOM elements in an array, and want to dynamically change a color based on some action:","<blockquote>function colorChange(arr, index, newColor) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;arr.splice(index, 1, newColor);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return arr;<br>}<br><br>let colorScheme = ['#878787', '#a08794', '#bb7e8c', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf'];<br><br>colorScheme = colorChange(colorScheme, 2, '#332327');<br>// we have removed '#bb7e8c' and added '#332327' in its place<br>// colorScheme now equals ['#878787', '#a08794', '#332327', '#c9b6be', '#d1becf']</blockquote>","This function takes an array of hex values, an index at which to remove an element, and the new color to replace the removed element with. The return value is an array containing a newly modified color scheme! While this example is a bit oversimplified, we can see the value that utilizing <code>splice()</code> to its maximum potential can have.","<hr>","We have defined a function, <code>htmlColorNames</code>, which takes an array of HTML colors as an argument.

The terms <dfn>dictionary</dfn>, <dfn>map</dfn>, and <dfn>hash table</dfn> all refer to the notion of a data structure in which specific keys, or properties, are mapped to specific values.<br><br>Objects, and other similar key-value pair data structures, offer some very useful benefits. One clear benefit is that they allow us to structure our data in an intuitive way; properties can be nested to an arbitrary depth, and values can be anything, including arrays and even other objects.<br><br>Largely due to this flexibility, objects are also the foundation for <dfn>JavaScript Object Notation</dfn>, or <dfn>JSON</dfn>, which is a widely used method of sending data across the web.",""],["","","Another powerful advantage of key-value pair data structures is <dfn>constant lookup time</dfn>. What this means, is that when you request the value of a specific property, you will get the value back in the same amount of time (theoretically) regardless of the number of entries in the object. If you had an object with 5 entries or one that held a collection of 1,000,000, you could still retrieve property values or check if a key exists in the same amount of time.<br><br>The reason for this fast lookup time, is that internally, the object is storing properties using a hashing mechanism which allows it to know exactly where it has stored different property values.

It is common to want to tell CSS how to align and space out the flex items a certain way. Fortunately, the <code>justify-content</code> property has several options to do this. But first, there is some important terminology to understand before reviewing those options.","<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox-1/images/flex-direction-terms.svg\" target=\"_blank\">Here is a useful image showing a row to illustrate the concepts below.</a>","Recall that setting a flex container as a row places the flex items side-by-side from left-to-right. A flex container set as a column places the flex items in a vertical stack from top-to-bottom. For each, the direction the flex items are arranged is called the <strong>main axis</strong>. For a row, this is a horizontal line that cuts through each item. And for a column, the main axis is a vertical line through the items.","There are several options for how to space the flex items along the line that is the main axis. One of the most commonly used is <code>justify-content: center;</code>, which aligns all the flex items to the center inside the flex container. Others options include:","<ul><li><code>flex-start</code>: aligns items to the start of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the left of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the top of the container.</li><li><code>flex-end</code>: aligns items to the end of the flex container. For a row, this pushes the items to the right of the container. For a column, this pushes the items to the bottom of the container.</li><li><code>space-between</code>: aligns items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed between the items. The first and last items are pushed to the very edge of the flex container. For example, in a row the first item is against the left side of the container, the last item is against the right side of the container, then the other items between them are spaced evenly.</li><li><code>space-around</code>: similar to <code>space-between</code> but the first and last items are not locked to the edges of the container, the space is distributed around all the items</li></ul>","<hr>","An example helps show this property in action.

It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have issues.","In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.","Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a <code>for</code> loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.","In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.","JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the <code>for</code> loop mentioned above, you could call the <code>map</code> method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the \"Off By One Errors\" that were covered in the Debugging section.","Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.","A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.","The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for <code>tabOpen()</code>, <code>tabClose()</code>, and <code>join()</code>. The array <code>tabs</code> is part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages.","<h4>Instructions<h4>","Run the code in the editor. It's using a method that has side effects in the program, causing incorrect output.
